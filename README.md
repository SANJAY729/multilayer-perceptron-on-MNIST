# multilayer-perceptron-on-MNIST

I implemented a MLP with 1 hidden layer and trained it on the MNSIT data set using numpy library, but i am encountering a runtime error while updating the weight matrices.
Using sklearn library able to get accuracy for 2 models with 1 hidden layer and 2 hidden layers of each size 100.
